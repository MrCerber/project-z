## What is Project Z?

Project Z is an **open-source communication platform** built on an **open protocol** — designed to be everything Discord promised but never fully delivered.

We are not trying to be *"Discord but faster."*

We are building a platform that **stands for something**.

> *The right to communicate freely, privately, and without fear — regardless of which government you live under.*

---

## Why?

Discord has become bloated, privacy-invasive, and increasingly bows to political and governmental pressure.

Existing alternatives (Matrix, Revolt, Element) either sacrifice UX for openness, or openness for UX. **None of them get both right.**

Project Z is built on a simple belief: you shouldn't have to choose between freedom and a great experience.

---

## Core Values

| Value | What it means |
|---|---|
| 🗣️ **Real freedom of speech** | No political censorship. Red lines based on universal human ethics, not trending politics |
| 🔍 **Structural transparency** | Political content, paid promotion, and bots are always visibly labeled — no hidden influence |
| 🔐 **Your data belongs to you** | Full deletion rights. Personal audit log — you always know what the system has done with your data |
| 🛡️ **No surrender** | We cooperate with law enforcement on real crimes. We do not capitulate to political pressure from any government or entity |
| 📱 **One client, everywhere** | No downloading a new app every time you join a community. One client, one experience |

---

## Key Features

<details>
<summary><b>🖥️ Three display modes</b></summary>
<br/>

- **Full Mode** — standard full-window experience
- **Sidebar Mode** — slides out from the side, stays accessible
- **Mini Mode** — inspired by Winamp/AIMP, always on screen while you game, work, or browse

No more dragging Discord between screens.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔒 Real end-to-end encryption</b></summary>
<br/>

- DMs and private channels → full E2E encryption (RSA-2048 + AES-256)
- Public channels → transport encryption (TLS 1.3) with full audit trail
- Voice/video → SRTP, server-blind even on SFU

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌍 Self Hosted with Data Residency</b></summary>
<br/>

Run your own server in your own country. Comply with local data laws without depending on us.

- Works identically to Cloud servers — same features, same client
- Registered in global Registry so other users can find it
- You own your data, you are responsible for it

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔓 Open Protocol</b></summary>
<br/>

Fully documented. Anyone can build a compatible client or server.

The official client will always be the best — like Chrome for HTTP.

Open protocol = practically impossible to block. No single point of failure.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📋 Personal Audit Log</b></summary>
<br/>

Every system action related to your account is logged and visible to you. Always. Including actions by the platform itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 Bot transparency</b></summary>
<br/>

Every bot must display its developer, purpose, and exact permissions. Bots cannot impersonate humans — ever.

All bot actions are logged in your personal audit log.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎨 MySpace-inspired personalization</b></summary>
<br/>

Profiles and server pages can look unique through CSS Sandboxed — without threatening client stability.

## Moderation Policy

We are not a police force. But we are responsible citizens.

```
Red lines (absolute):
  ✗  Content involving minors (under 18)
  ✗  Terrorism planning
  ✗  Human trafficking

On violation:
  → Evidence snapshot (encrypted)
  → Filed with relevant authorities (Interpol, FBI, Europol, local police)
  → Evidence handed over — their responsibility from there

Symmetry principle (applies to everyone):
  ✓  Criminals               → removed
  ✓  Government without court order → refused
  ✓  Political pressure      → refused
  ✓  Corporate pressure      → refused
```
